# zipFinderKR

- This project was built to help co-workers with no programming background having a hardship while working on their civil affairs administration job.

- Since 2015, South Korea introduced new format of a zip code, but unfortunately many appened documents are submitted by old format of a zip code. 

- Government of Korea distributed old-to-new zip code converter, but it merely converts old zip code that 'only' has city, district, and address line 1. If address line 2 and 3 are attached afterwards, it fails to convert. 

- Hence I decided to make a simple program that reads an appened document, splits unnecessary information, then compare with zip code db provided by Korean governmet and allocate a new zip code.
